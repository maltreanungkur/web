Hey, welcome to my homepage! I'm Treanungkur, a second-year student at the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. I originally made this site to upload problem sets and lecture notes for the UDGRP 2024, but now I also plan to share cool math theorems and problems that I find interesting.

If you're in the GGT UDGRP, you can find all the lecture notes and problem sets under the "Teaching" tab. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me or Rinkiny Di. Want to know more about me and my interests? Check out the "About" section!
