Welcome to the Undergraduate Directed Group Reading Program (UDGRP) 2024! This year, we will explore Geometric Group Theory (GGT). 

In the initial lectures, we’ll review basic group theory concepts and provide problem sets periodically. Please make a sincere effort to solve them, as this practice will prove invaluable in the long run. If you have any doubts, feel free to reach out to any of the instructors—we’re here to help!

To make things more engaging, we’ll introduce a "Chocolate Problem" at the end of each class. Anyone who provides a meaningful attempt—be it partial, intuitive, or without a rigorous proof—will be rewarded with chocolates! (Sadly, we can’t hand out Fields Medals, but hey, chocolates are a good start, right?)

Our goal with this approach is to encourage you to engage with the material actively. Mathematics is a discipline where simply knowing the theory isn’t enough—you must learn how to apply it effectively. And the best way to do so? Solve as many problems as possible!

You’ll find all the lecture notes and problem sets on this website. If you miss a lecture, don’t worry—we’ll keep everything updated here so you can catch up.

## Timeline

### 0. Introductory Talk

**Date**: October 19, 2024. <br>
**Speakers**: Rinkiny Ghatak and Treanungkur Mal. <br>

Rinkiny began by briefly introducing the definition of a group and providing some examples. She then defined free groups and explored the structure of Cayley graphs, including how the Cayley graph of a free group looks. Additionally, she introduced the concept of group presentations, concluding her talk with the group presentation of the well-known Lamplighter Group.

Whereas I have tried to demonstrate how one can understand a complex group presentation, such as that of the Lamplighter Group, by using the analogy of street lamps. Interestingly, the seemingly intricate presentation simplifies to switching finitely many lamps on an infinite street comprising infinitely many lamps. I also provided a brief definition of a group action, as this concept will be central to our study moving forward.

### 1. Basics of Group Theory

**Date**: November 25, 2024.<br>
**Speaker**: Rinkiny Ghatak. <br>

In this lecture, Rinkiny covered the basics of group theory, including:
- Definition of Group
- Examples of Group $\left( \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}), \text{SL}_n(\mathbb{R}), S_n \right)$
- Subgroups
- Group Presentations (Generators and Relators)
- Structure preserving maps in Groups (Homomorphism and Isomorphism)
- Normal Subgroups and Cosets
- Kernal and Image of an Homomorphism
- The 1st Isomorphism Theorem
