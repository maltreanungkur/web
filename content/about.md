Hey there! I’m Treanungkur (pronounced tri-nang-kur), but feel free to call me whatever version of my name works for you. I’m from Howrah and currently a second-year student at the Indian Statistical Insititute, Bangalore.

My current obsession? Algebra! There's just something magical about how it brings structure to chaos. But honestly, I'm equally excited about anything math-related—it’s the perfect blend of logic, creativity, and endless curiosity. But please don't come to me to talk about statistics, i just hate it!. I’m always up for a chat about Group Theory or Algebra in general (right now, Linear Algebra is my go-to). So, if you're into Group Theory or Linear Algebra, feel free to meet me while I’m on campus. I also enjoy talking to juniors, even though I haven’t had many chances to do so yet! Also, ya I love Geometry too, so if you are interested we can also talk about it!

When I’m not lost in problem sets or assignments, I love chatting about math or jotting down random thoughts in LaTeX. If you’re into math too or just want to know how to say "Treanungkur" without a tongue-twist, feel free to reach out!
